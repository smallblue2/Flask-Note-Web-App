## Flask-Note-Web-App
My first web application - built from Flask and Jinja.

This is a simple web application I made in my first semester of my BsC Computer Science.

It was my first venture into databases (SQLite), authentication, password hashing, routing and more, and made me realise my love of backend!
I also got to practice some basic templating with Jinja, some traditional CSS and a tiny bit of javascript!

## Installation & Running
It's super simple!

1. Clone the repository - `git clone https://github.com/smallblue2/Flask-Note-Web-App`
2. Install the requirements - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Flask app - `python main.py`
4. Visit the app in your browser! - `http://localhost:5000`
